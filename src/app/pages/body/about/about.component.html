                    My name is Nurudeen Olanrewaju Bada. I am a Front-end Developer focused on Angular as 
                    my frontend stack. Though my undergraduate study was not in computer science or any 
                    tech related field, I have always wanted to further my career in a more dynamic and practical
                    industry like the technology industry, particularly in software development, which has 
                    hence shaped my career decisions.

                <p>
                    I started my journey with the basics of Frontend Development just like any other aspiring developer
                    taking online courses, reading any PDF material I could get my hands on amongst other things. To further hone 
                    my skills, I undertook a bootcamp and that was a game changer because I was introduced to different concepts 
                    of frontend development.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    I have worked as a freelancer for different clients on series of projects and also took up employment 
                    opportunities to further develop and gain more industrial experience.
